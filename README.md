## The Task
Bellabeat, a company that creates health related smart products, has asked for insights on consumer data in hopes to create opportunities for the marketing team to expand upon. Bellabeat's products focus on activity, sleep, and stress monitoring for women. They would like to know how non-Bellabeat customers use smart devices for their health.

## Cleaning the data
Please look at my other file containing the SQL code used to clean the data. Some issues were found while cleaning the data. One being there were some duplicate rows that were removed in order to maintain an accurate analysis. Also, out of the 33 participants in the data, only 8 were actually logging their weight. This changed how I would go about analyzing since I didn't feel the weight information contained enough participants to utilize the data from that CSV file.
